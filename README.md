### 📋 **How to Register**

**Step 1: In-Game Registration**
1. Join the 7 Days to Die server
2. Open chat and type: `!register`
3. The bot will send you a **6-digit code** via private message in-game
4. Remember this code (you have 30 minutes to use it)

**Step 2: Discord Registration**
1. Go to your Discord server where the bot is active
2. Use the slash command: `/7dregister code:123456` (replace with your actual code)
3. The bot will confirm your registration and link your accounts

### ✅ **Registration Benefits**
- **Player Statistics**: View your playtime, currency, and activity with `/7dplayerinfo`
- **Welcome Messages**: Get personalized (sarcastic) greetings when you join
- **Enhanced Tracking**: Your sessions and activities are tracked in the database
- **Future Features**: Registration enables additional bot features and commands

### 🔧 **Technical Details**
- **Codes expire** after 30 minutes for security
- **Steam ID linking**: Automatically captures your Steam and Epic/EOS IDs
- **Database storage**: Securely stores registration data locally
- **One-time process**: Registration only needs to be done once per player

### 🚨 **Troubleshooting**
- **Code not working?** Make sure you're using the exact 6-digit number
- **Code expired?** Type `!register` in-game again to get a new code
- **Already registered?** The bot will tell you if your account is already linked
- **No code received?** Check if the bot is connected and telnet is working
